[[_TOC_]]


## INTRODUCTION

To Set out the needs and requirements of the business with regards to uptime, error allowance and performance of systems commensurate with business needs.

## COMMON LANGUAGE

_SLA_ - Service level agreements

_SLO_ - Service level objectives can give a low-noise signal as to the overall health of services.

_SLI_ - Service level indicators is a quantitative measure of some aspect of the service. Typically this could be latency or availability.

_"Three 9s"_ refers to 99.9% uptime, this allows an error budget of 1 minus the SLO or SLA. For example three 9s would allow 1000 errors from 100,000 requests to an API without breaching contractual agreements.

_"Four 9s"_ refers to 99.99% uptime, this allows an error budget of 1 minus the SLO or SLA. For example four 9s would allow 100 errors from 100,000 requests to an API without breaching contractual agreements.

_Error Budget_ - An error budget is the maximum amount of time that a technical system can fail without contractual consequences.

_Compliance Periods_ - The period of time of which the SLO/SLA is measured. e.g. a rolling 30 day period, or rolling 12 month period, or a fixed quarter.


## AGREED SERVICE LEVELS

- SLO
   - Latency - TBD
   - Availability - Uptime of Three nines (8.77 hours error budget) per 12 month rolling period.
